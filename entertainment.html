        <h2>What is National Herald case</h2>
        <p>
          In 2012, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and advocate Subramanian Swamy filed a complaint before a trial court alleging that some Congress leaders were involved in cheating and breach of trust in the acquisition of Associated Journals Ltd by Young Indian Ltd (YIL). He alleged that YIL had 'taken over' the assets of the National Herald in a 'malicious' way.

Both Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi have been summoned by the ED in a probe related to the National Herald case. The ED is currently probing the shareholding pattern, the financial transactions of AJL and YIL, and the role of party functionaries in the functioning of the two entities.
<b>Who has been named in the National Herald case by Subramanian Swamy?</b>Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Motilal Vora, Oscar Fernandes, journalist Suman Dubey and technocrat Sam Pitroda have been named in Swamy’s National Herald case.

        <h2>Studio Ghibli-Inspired AI Art Trend Sparks Debate Over Ethics, Copyright</h2>
        <p>
          The issue extends beyond individual rights. It highlights the growing tension between human creativity and corporate profit. The recent surge of Studio Ghibli-inspired images generated by artificial intelligence has reignited a heated debate on the ethics of AI-generated art, raising critical concerns over copyright, artist consent, and the commercialization of creative work. The trend, which quickly gained momentum across social media platforms, showcased highly stylized artworks mimicking the signature aesthetics of the renowned Japanese animation studio. While visually compelling, these images have prompted widespread backlash from artists and creatives who argue that such tools rely heavily on artwork scraped from the internet—often without consent or credit to the original creators.
